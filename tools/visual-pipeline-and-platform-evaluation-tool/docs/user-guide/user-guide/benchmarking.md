# Benchmarking

ViPPET provides two benchmarking modes for evaluating AI inference pipeline performance on Intel® hardware:

- **Performance Testing** — Run one or more pipelines with a fixed number of streams and measure throughput
  (FPS), system utilization, and optionally latency in real time.
- **Density Testing** — Automatically find the maximum number of concurrent streams that maintain a target
  FPS floor, using an exponential-growth and binary-search algorithm.

Both modes share a common execution configuration and report results through the same job management system.

## Key concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total FPS**       | Aggregate frames per second across all active streams                                |
| **Per Stream FPS**  | Average FPS per individual stream (Total FPS ÷ stream count)                         |
| **FPS Floor**       | Minimum acceptable per-stream FPS used as the pass/fail threshold in density testing |
| **Stream Rate**     | Percentage of total streams allocated to each pipeline (must sum to 100%)            |
| **Output Mode**     | Controls whether output video is saved to file, streamed live, or disabled           |
| **Latency Metrics** | Optional end-to-end pipeline latency measurement (avg/min/max) reported per interval |

## Workflow overview

1. **Configure** — Select pipelines, set stream counts or density parameters, and choose output options.
2. **Run** — Start the test; ViPPET creates a job and begins executing pipelines as subprocesses.
3. **Monitor** — Real-time system metrics (CPU, GPU, NPU, memory, power) and pipeline metrics (FPS)
   are displayed in the dashboard while the job runs.
4. **Review results** — When the job completes, view final FPS and output videos in the job detail view.
